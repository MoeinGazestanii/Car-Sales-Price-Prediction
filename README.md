# Car-Sales-Price-Prediction(streamlit)

I have chosen a dataset about used cars that has 13 variables and I plan to use a suitable regression model to predict the prices of used cars.
In the beginning, I am going to give some basic descriptive statistics about the variables. Managing missing values and data cleaning would be the next steps. Furthermore, I would also perform outlier detection and assess the correlation between independent variables, followed by an Exploratory Data Analysis. After that fitting regression models is the final step.
