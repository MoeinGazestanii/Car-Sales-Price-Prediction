# Car-Sales-Price-Prediction(streamlit)

I have selected a dataset on used cars, comprising 13 variables, to develop a predictive model for estimating car prices. The workflow for this project is structured as follows:

    Descriptive Statistics:
    Conduct an initial analysis to summarize key statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for all variables.

    Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values:
    Identify and address missing or inconsistent data to ensure the dataset's integrity.

    Outlier Detection and Treatment:
    Implement appropriate techniques to detect and mitigate the impact of outliers on model performance.

    Correlation Analysis:
    Evaluate relationships between independent variables to identify multicollinearity and ensure feature relevance.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Perform comprehensive visual and statistical analyses to uncover trends, distributions, and patterns in the data.

    Model Development:
    Fit and evaluate suitable regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso) to predict car prices effectively.

    Model Evaluation:
    Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R², RMSE, MAE) to ensure accuracy and reliability.
